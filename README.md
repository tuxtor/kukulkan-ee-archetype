## Introduction

Kukulkan EE is an opinionated bootstrap archetype for JavaEE/JakartaEE 8.0 and Microprofile 3 family.

The principal motivator behind this is time. Despite being the foundation of Enterprise Java ecosystem, bootstrapping CDI projects is a time consuming and sometimes redundant task.

Hence Kukulkan EE was created with the following principles:

* Provide a bootstrap project for traditional .war deployments, fat jars, just enough application server and Docker.
* Allow type-safe and fast data repository generation with Deltaspike Data
* Allow CI/CD workflows through Arquillian and Maven
* Execute compatibility tests using GitHub Actions.

Kukulkan integrates the following dependencies:

* Java 11 - As language
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) - SCM/Task Runner
* [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/) - log abstraction using JDK log by default, (as CDI producer)
* [Payara 5](https://www.payara.fish/) - runtime (with uber-jar support)
* [Jakarta EE 8](https://jakarta.ee/) and [MicroProfile 3.3](https://microprofile.io/) - APIs
* [JKube](https://www.eclipse.org/jkube/) for basic Docker/K8S control using Maven

This is a work in progress.

## Why Kukulkan?

In the Mayan mithology [Kukulkan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kukulkan) is one of the deities that created (hence bootstrapped) the universe.

Also as an internal joke, this project is a maintained/useful project for a [Guatemalan company](https://www.nabenik.com/) and people in Guatemala tend to overuse Mayan terms.

## Specification examples

By default, Kukulkan includes the creation of a JAX-RS application class to define the path for endpoints.

Also, a simple Hello world endpoint is created, have a look **HelloController** class.

More information on MicroProfile can be found [here](https://microprofile.io/)

## Pristine project

This archetype is based on [kukulkan-ee](https://github.com/tuxtor/kukulkan-ee) project which maintains a base project to execute CI and ensure archetype health.

## How to use this archetype 

To generate a Docker/JakartaEE/MicroProfile base project, you could invoke this archetype:

> mvn archetype:generate \
-DarchetypeGroupId=com.nabenik \
-DarchetypeArtifactId=kukulkan-ee-archetype \
-DarchetypeVersion=0.0.1-SNAPSHOT -DgroupId=io.academik \
-DartifactId=cool-academik-backend -Dversion=2.0-SNAPSHOT

This will generate a base Java project with all libraries activated and persistence on H2 database (default provider in Payara).

After that any Java IDE will suffice to develop your next microserice with Java.
